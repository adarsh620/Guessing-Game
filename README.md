# Guessing-Game


The fun and easy project “Guessing-Game” is a short Java project that allows the user to guess the number generated by the computer & involves the following steps:

1. The system generates a random number from a given range, say 1 to 100.
2. The user is prompted to enter their given number in a displayed dialogue box.
3. The computer then tells if the entered number matches the guesses number or it is higher/lower than the generated number.
4. The game continues under the user guessing the number.
